Semantica uses the Apache Solr solution as index and search engine.

Apache Solr can index contents by using both their descriptors in XML or in JSON and
the plain office documents.
When a search query is sent against Apache Solr, only the descriptors of the
contents matching the query are returned. 

Semantica requires some additional attributes in the content descriptor, so they
are defined in the schema.xml file.
