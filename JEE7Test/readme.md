This project aims to aid us in porting of Silverpeas in JEE 7 and Java 8.
Thanks to it, we can select only the peculiar parts of Silverpeas that can drive an issue when deploying in Wildfly 8.1 and then find a way to resolve it.

This project depends upon another one in the sandbox repository, JEE7Test-Component. This project is an attempt to mock a component in Silverpeas that will be included into the final project deployment archive.
So, you will have to first build the JEE7Test-Component project before this.
